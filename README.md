This contains the project I have done with the help of OpenCV and whatever tutorials I have done on OpenCV, I have gathered them here so I 
have a collection to know where I can pick the code from.

The scanner is something I have picked up an idea from an article and made some changes to it.Basically, switching it from WebCam based criteria photo scanning to Normal Image Picture Scanning

Example.Png is the example for Partial Scanner. You can see 4 feature points on the laptop screen and that instead of focusing on the sheet of paper, it focuses entirely on the laptop screen which is a bigger contour according to it. Thus, it picks it up separately.
